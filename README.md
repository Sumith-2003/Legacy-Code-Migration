# Legacy Code Migration

Developed an AI-driven solution to automate the migration of legacy code from **Delphi, COBOL, and VB** to modern technologies such as **C and Java**, significantly reducing manual effort and errors. It utilizes **machine learning models** like **Deep Q-learning** and **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to analyze and translate legacy code snippets. The application also features a **chatbot powered by GPT-3 API** to assist users with code documentation and queries.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Automated Legacy Code Migration** â€“ Converts legacy code (e.g., Delphi, COBOL, VB) to modern languages (e.g., Java, C).
- **Machine Learning-Based Analysis** â€“ Uses **Deep Q-learning** and **NLU** to improve translation accuracy.
- **Chatbot Integration** â€“ Powered by **GPT-3 API**, it helps with code documentation and user queries.
- **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Backend Server** â€“ Implemented using **Flask** for seamless API interactions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

### **Backend**
- Flask

### **Machine Learning Models**
- Deep Q-learning
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

## ðŸ“Œ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sumith-2003/Legacy-Code-Migration.git
   cd Legacy-Code-Migration
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```sh
   cd project
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## ðŸ“– Usage

1. Upload or paste legacy code into the interface.
2. Select the target programming language for migration.
3. The AI-powered system will analyze and convert the code.
4. Use the chatbot for documentation and code-related queries.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
- Support for additional programming languages.
- Improved AI model accuracy for complex code migrations.
- Integration with cloud services for scalable processing.
